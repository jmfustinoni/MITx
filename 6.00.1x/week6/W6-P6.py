# Does this function sort the list in increasing or decreasing order? (items at

# What happens to the behavior of swapSort with this new code? 
# No change
# modSwapSort now orders the list in descending order for all lists. [X]
# modSwapSort now orders the list in descending order for SOME lists but not all
# modSwapSort enters an infinite loop.

# What happens to the time complexity of this modSwapSort? Best and worst cases
# stay the same. [X] 
# Worst case stays the same but best case changes. 
# Best and worst cases change.
