# MITx Computacional Thinking using Python
The courses in the XSeries are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. Some of the people taking the two courses will use them as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many it will be their first and last computer science courses. Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are not “computation appreciation” courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will.

## Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python (6.00.1x)
This course is the first of a two-course sequence: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python, and Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science. Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. Some of the people taking the two courses will use them as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many it will be their first and last computer science courses. This run features lecture videos, lecture exercises, and problem sets using Python 3.5. Even if you previously took the course with Python 2.7, you will be able to easily transition to Python 3.5 in future courses, or enroll now to refresh your learning.

### What you'll learn
1. A Notion of computation
1. The Python programming language
1. Some simple algorithms
1. Testing and debugging
1. An informal introduction to algorithmic complexity
1. Data structures

## Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science (6.00.2x)
This course  will teach you how to use computation to accomplish a variety of goals and provides you with a brief introduction to a variety of topics in computational problem solving . This course is aimed at students with some prior programming experience in Python and a rudimentary knowledge of computational complexity. You will spend a considerable amount of time writing programs to implement the concepts covered in the course. For example, you will write a program that will simulate a robot vacuum cleaning a room or will model the population dynamics of viruses replicating and drug treatments in a patient's body.

### What you'll learn
1. Advanced programming in Python 3
1. Knapsack problem, Graphs and graph optimization
1. Dynamic programming
1. Plotting with the pylab package
1. Random walks
1. Probability, Distributions
1. Monte Carlo simulations
1. Curve fitting
1. Statistical fallacies
