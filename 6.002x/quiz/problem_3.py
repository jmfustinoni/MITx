You are given a list of unique positive integers L sorted in descending order 
and a positive integer sum s. The list has n elements. Consider writing a 
program that finds values for multipliers  such that the following equation 
holds: 

s=L[0]∗m0+L[1]∗m1+...+L[n−1]∗mn−1
    
Assume a greedy approach to this problem. You calculate the integer multipliers
m_0, m_1, ..., m_(n-1) by finding the largest multiplier possible for the 
largest value in the list, then for the second largest, and so on. Write a 
function that returns the sum of the multipliers using this greedy approach. 
If the greedy approach does not yield a set of multipliers such that the 
equation above sums to s, return the string "no solution". Write the function 
implementing this greedy algorithm with the specification below:

        Use the greedy approach where you find the largest multiplier for 
        the largest value in L then for the second largest, and so on to
