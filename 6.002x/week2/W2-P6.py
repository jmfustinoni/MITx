Problem 6: Data Plotting

Now, you'll use your simulation to answer some questions about the robots' 
performance.

In order to do this problem, you will be using a Python tool called PyLab. 

Below is an example of a plot. This plot does not use the same axes that your 
plots will use; it merely serves as an example of the types of images that the 
PyLab package produces.

 
Note to those who did the optional visualization: For problem 6, we make calls 
to runSimulation() to get simulation data and plot it. However, you don't want 
the visualization getting in the way. If you chose to do the visualization 
exercise, before you get started on problem 6 (and before you submit your code 
in submission boxes), make sure to comment the visualization code out of 
runSimulation(). There should be 3 lines to comment out. If you do not comment 
these lines, your code will take a REALLY long time to run!!

For the questions below, call the given function with the proper arguments to 
generate a plot using PyLab.

## Problem 6-1
Examine showPlot1 in ps2.py, which takes in the parameters title, x_label, and 
y_label. Your job is to examine the code and figure out what the plot produced 
by the function tells you. Try calling showPlot1 with appropriate arguments to 
produce a few plots. Then, answer the following 3 questions.


1. Which of the following would be the best title for the graph?
Time It Takes 1 - 10 Robots To Clean 80% Of A Room

2. Which of the following would be the best x-axis label for the graph?
Number of Robots

3. Which of the following would be the best y-axis label for the graph?
Time-steps

## Problem 6-2
Examine showPlot2 in ps2.py, which takes in the parameters title, x_label, and 
y_label. Your job is to examine the code and figure out what the plot produced 
by the function tells you. Try calling showPlot2 with appropriate arguments to 
produce a few plots. Then, answer the following 3 questions.

1. Which of the following would be the best title for the graph?
Time It Takes Two Robots To Clean 80% Of Variously Shaped Rooms

Examine showPlot2 in ps2.py, which takes in the same parameters as showPlot1. 
Your job is to examine the code and figure out what the plot produced by the 
function tells you. Try calling showPlot2 with appropriate arguments to produce
a few plots. Then, answer the following 3 questions.

2. Which of the following would be the best x-axis label for the graph?
Aspect Ratio

3. Which of the following would be the best y-axis label for the graph?
Time-steps
